# QR-Code-based-Attendance
Mark attendance by scanning QR Code displayed on class projector

* Semester: Second
* Course: ICT

In our 50 minutes long class, 10 to 15 minutes are wasted because of the teacher calling out names for attendance. Things get worse when late comers keep nagging the teacher to mark their attendance. 

To avoid this daily nuisance, we made an android app that let's student scan QR code to mark their attendance. The teacher displays an automatically generated QR code for a span of one minute on the class projector. The students then scan the code to mark their attendance through phones. An excel sheet is generated for that session.

We were not able to link this to our NUST CMS where are attendance is officially marked because we could not get permission to access CMS student data.
